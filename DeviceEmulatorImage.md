# Device Emulator Image #

To execute RR applications on PC are required:
  1. [Microsoft Device Emulator 3.0](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5352)
  1. WinCE image of this project. [Current version 1.1](http://code.google.com/p/roadrover/downloads/detail?name=RoadRoverEmulator_v1.1.zip)

Install Device Emulator. After that unzip RoadRoverEmulator.zip into a local directory (e.g. C:\RoadRover\). Run roadrover.bat or roadrover\_skined.bat (for skined GUI).

By default "Storage Card" in WinCE is mounted to subfolder RoadRoverEmulator\SD. You can change it in config.bat file.
